                  <h2>Personal Goals</h2>

                  <p>Shenny has always been outgoing, friendly, and goal driven. From the very beginning since she moved to this country at the age of 14 she has built her way up into the corporate banking world. She has the biggest heart, always willing to help those in need and her story is truly inspiring. My goals currently are to grow my family hopefully to add 2 new additions in the coming future and one day buying my dream home.  Here's a glimpse into her life on what interests her and keeps her day's busy!</p>
